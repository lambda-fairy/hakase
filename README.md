# Hakase

![Hakase da nyan~](hakase.gif)

**Hakase** is a toolkit for running [Rock–Paper–Scissors] programming contests.

While the server is written in Haskell, competing bots may be written using any general-purpose programming language. Competitors run their bots on their own machines, which communicate with the server using a custom protocol. This protocol is easy to implement, and is described in the spec (which I haven't written yet lol).
